    "One of the issues with the webcrawl is that Google does not approve of webcrawls and thus sporadically denies access to their search engine after too many requests. Being mindful of this I chose to only crawl every 1-6 seconds. However Google would still deny access at some points. As a work around I logged the last succesful labelling into the file crawl_log.txt. So when the code throws an error, we have the latest succesful labeling. I then wrote a bash script to find the last label and start the program again from where it was previously denied access. I made sure to be mindful of Google, and would only rerun the program every hour, until the webcrawl was succesfully complete. "

    "The convergence Component starts by assigning all the categories an equal score. As the scores improve or worsen, the relative probability of being asked a question from the category changes. This is done by assigning each category a normalized probability based on its accuracy of answering questions. The higher the accuracy the more likely the question is asked. Once the variations in accuracy are sufficently small or after a specified number of iterations, the category with the highest accuracy is selected."
