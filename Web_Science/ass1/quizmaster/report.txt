A place to keep notes over the development proccess of QuizMaster

Classification Component

Instead of using Machine Learning like a normal person, I want to create a super naive
Web Crawl. It should just search the question, and then find the first word that matches a set
of words. The set of words are keywords for each topic. The first word to match, gives the classification
based on which question it pertains to.
